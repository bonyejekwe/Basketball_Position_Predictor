A series of models to predict NBA basketball positions based on player data.

**Files:**

-KNN_Model.ipynb: k-Nearest Neighbor model for 3 position (Guard, Forward, and Center) characterization, using data from [NBAstuffer](https://www.nbastuffer.com/2021-2022-nba-player-stats/) from 2018 to 2021. Incorporates feature scaling, grid search for optimal k value, feature selection, and cross validation.
